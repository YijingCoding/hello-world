# hello-world
Holle World project
Yesterday, I enrolled in the deeplearning.ai course at Coursera. I have the following reasons.
First, as a Ph.D. candidate in Control Theory & Engineering, I should understand what is AI and how does it work. 
Second, the demand for AI in the industry has increased a lot. The knowledge of AI will be a great addition to my resume.
Third, I was not confident in programming when I was an undergraduate. I want to gain confidence by learning Python. 

Today I create an account at Github to record my improvement day by day. Just do it!
